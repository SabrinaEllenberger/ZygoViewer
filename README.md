# ZygoViewer

ZygoViewer is a GUI for visualization of research results of the Wöstemeyer group (Institute of General Microbiology and Microbial Genetics, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany) on two zygomycetous fungi. _Absidia glauca_ and _Parasitella parasitica_ has been recognised early as the best model organisms for studying host-parasite interactions and later on for studying naturally occurring horizontal gene transfer. ZygoViewer shows the gene predictions of a _Absidia glauca_ and a _Parasitella parasitica_ genome sequenced by this group. In addition, ZygoViewer manages a set of data and videos on predicted protein structures and modelled dimers of a key enzyme in biosynthesis of hormonally active trisporoids, the 4‑dihydromethyltrisporate dehydrogenase (TSP1).
