# ZygoViewer

ZygoViewer is a GUI for visualization of research results of the Wöstemeyer group (Institute
of General Microbiology and Microbial Genetics, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany)
on two zygomycetous fungi. _Absidia glauca_ and _Parasitella parasitica_ has been recognised
early as the best model organisms for studying host-parasite interactions and later on for
studying naturally occurring horizontal gene transfer. ZygoViewer shows the gene predictions
of a _Absidia glauca_ and a _Parasitella parasitica_ genome sequenced by this group. In addition,
ZygoViewer manages a set of data and videos on predicted protein structures and modelled dimers
of a key enzyme in biosynthesis of hormonally active trisporoids, the 4‑dihydromethyltrisporate
dehydrogenase (TSP1).

We created models of tertiary structures and performed protein-ligand docking as well as protein-
protein docking to investigate substrate specificity and dimerization. The resulting structure
models show differences in putative enzyme activity and binding preferences. The ability of TSP1
to form homodimers with enzymatic activity is the crucial difference between sexual and parasitic
communication in _Parasitella parasitica_. In contrast, the TSP1 from _Absidia glauca_ seem to be
only modulated not regulated. At the interface between host and parasite, TSP1 of both fungi can
interact with each other and support the specific function of single TSP1 isomers.
